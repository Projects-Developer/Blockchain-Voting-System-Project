## Abstract
This project presents a blockchain-based voting system, designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electoral process. Leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, this system ensures the integrity of votes, protects voter identities, and enables real-time results. Our solution addresses the shortcomings of traditional voting systems, promoting voter trust, and enhancing the democratic process.
